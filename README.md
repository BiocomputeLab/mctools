### Motif Clustering Tools

The `mctools` package provides command-line applications to calculate overall clustering of a given motif within a network (`mcc`), break this clustering down into a distribution of the clustering types (`mcstats`), and extract these subgraphs from the original network ('mcextract`).

The distribution contains binary versions of these programs that are ready to run for most operating systems (Windows, Linux and Mac OS X). However, for best possible performance we advise compilation from source. See the documentation for further information.
